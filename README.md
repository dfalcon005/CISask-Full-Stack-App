# cisask
  This started as a final project for my full-stack web development class. The purpose of the site is to give CIS students at the University of Houston a platform to connect with each other whether it be about classes, professors, or career help. This has been my favorite project I have ever worked on so I decided that I would continue improving it and adding more features to it after completing the class. I still have many more features that I am currently working on and plan on adding soon.

  The reason I really enjoyed working on this project is because I finally got to put all the things I have learned about web development together to create a full functioning application. From setting up the back-end MongoDB schema models, creating the APIs, and learning about User Authentication to creating the different views and features for the users. This has been a great learning experience that is still not over as I gain more knowledge and add more features.
