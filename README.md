# CISask
  This started as a final project for my full-stack web development class. The purpose of the site is to give CIS students at the University of Houston a platform to seek advice from other CIS students about classes, professors, or career help. This has been my favorite project I have worked on so I decided that I would continue improving it and adding more features to it after completing the class. I still have many more features that I am currently working on and plan on adding soon.

  The reason I really enjoyed working on this project is because I finally got to put all the things I have learned about web development together to create a full functioning application. I created my backend using MongoDB as a database. I used Node, Express, and Mongoose to run my server, create the Data Models and create the APIs so that I could use my data in my front-end. The front-end was creating using Vue.js to create the pages that the user gets to see and interact with. I also used Vuex for state management for User Authentication. 
  
  This has been a great learning experience that is still not over as continue learning and add more features.
